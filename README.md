Problem: What is the problem you are addressing, why is it significant?
The problem that we are addressing through our program is the lack of  a proper system for students to access the education and assistance they deserve. Through our experience in high school, we realized that not every student receives the education they need in order to succeed. We know how difficult it is to locate credible tutors quickly. We want to change this so that those who come after us don’t need to struggle with the same hardships we’ve gone through, so that we can lessen their stress from courses by providing tools that they should already have. 
Solution: What is the idea of your project, how original is the solution? 
The idea is to become the biggest fully-scalable solution to pair up students with tutors around the world. Our project aims to make tutors more accessible to students, making the whole process faster, simpler, and efficient. It allows students to learn skills directly from the tutor, making it more efficient than pre-recorded online courses.
Regarding originality, we can’t think of a service that does what we do. Yes, CHS provides tutoring in the library but the hours and tutors are extremely limited. Our service has everything in one spot, messaging, scheduling, and a variety of tutors. Not only this but students can choose to schedule OR use a tutor from moment to moment. Saying if a student is in need of a tutor, they can find one within minutes who’ll be able to assist them.
Implementation: How well done is the implementation? Is the design easy to use, clean, and bug free?
Our website and mock code are first drafts of our product. Currently we have a variety of features going between personal profiles to favorite tutors. We intend to implement a few more features in the near future such as scheduling, an AI assistant, and much more.
Practicality: Would the product be used for its purpose in the real world? Does it serve its purpose without being an extra hassle?
Helps connect students and tutors better. Educators can earn more for their knowledge, and students can learn better. 
Better than google because 1:1 tutoring allows the learner to directly communicate with the teacher, developing new ideas and learning faster than staring at a screen. The teacher can directly tell you what you did wrong.
